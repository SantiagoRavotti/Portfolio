## Analysis of Copenhagen  Rental-rooms with WebScrapping, Python and Tableau

A couple of weeks before I moved to Copenhagen, I wanted to know what I could expect to pay per month for a room in the metropolitan area, as well as the size of the rooms. This, after being added to multiple Whatsapp groups for Expats in Copenhagen, was a common question among those of us who decided to move to Denmark. 

So I decided to do Web Scrapping on the website *boligportal.dk* with Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, request, geopy and Pandas, and get a data frame with zip codes, areas, sizes and prices.

Once I finished cleaning, replacing, sorting and deleting data in Excel, I proceeded to visualise this data in Tableau. Here is the visual result of the project.

If you are interested in the Python code and steps to get the data and place it inside a Pandas dataframe, check the GitHub repository at the following link, where you will find a Jupyther Notebook with all the steps:

If you want to see the visualisations interactively in my Tableau Public, this is the link to my profile:
